# Implementations

Current:

- Intel, created and holds most copyrights for IA-32
- AMD, created and holds copyrights for x86-64

Past:

-   VIA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_Technologies . Bought:

    -   Cyrix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix from National Semiconductor
    -   Centaur https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_Technology

Intel and AMD are the major ones.

Cyrix was an implementor before being bought by National Semiconductor, and VIA continue to produce them after buying Cyrix from NS.

## x86 licensing

You need a license to implement x86, at least the parts which are newer than 20 years ago:

- Cyrix got into trouble for not licensing it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix#Legal_troubles

Intel and AMD have cross-licensing agreements:
