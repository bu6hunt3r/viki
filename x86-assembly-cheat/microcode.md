# Microcode

Intel processors have a large front-end that decodes every instruction to a simpler internal undocumented and unaccessible instruction set.

The undocumented internal instructions are also known as microcode.

The internal microcode interpreter is known as the RISC core.

It also seems that microcode can be changed with firmware updates.
